A python script for simulating Warmachine/Hordes attack scenarios

To simulate an attack, you just invoke destruction_simulator.py with a configuration file.  

Configuration files are JSON formatted, and examples can be found in the simulations folder.

In these files, you configure the paramters of the attack you want to simulate.

Run a file thusly:

'python destruction_simulator.py simulations/galleon_against_imperatus.json'
